Custom evaluation tasks for lighteval.

This file generally creates just a TASKS_TABLE and TASKS_GROUPS which are then imported by LightEval.

Source dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/monsoon-nlp/genetic-counselor-multiple-choice
Questions combined from three Quizlets.

In order to have comparable results to ours, please do not forget to run with --use-chat-template
